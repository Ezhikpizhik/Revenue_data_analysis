Significance test of the incremental value for assigning a lead to the sales team
The table below shows the Z-test calculatiuons for the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the revenue mean of assigned and unassinged leads for every year. The significance test showed that with 95% confidence, the revenue difference between asssigned and unassigned leads for:

Account age under 1 year: from $18.2M to $40.9M
Account age between 1 and 2 years: from $25.9M to $90.2M
Account age between 2 ans 3 years: from $47.1M to $106.6M
Account age between 3 and 4 years: from $35.5M to $100.5M (only 9 unassigned samples, so these values should be taken with a grain of salt)
Note that for the analysis of the incremental value, we can only use the first 4 rows because only these rows have enough leads to see statistical results.

Note: Age<0 was also included in the calculations (it doesn't seem to affect the outcome, probably the age was input by mistake). This way all the data is preserved in the calculations.
