## Results for the Incremental value of assigning a lead to the sales team

Significance test of the incremental value for assigning a lead to the sales team was done.

Z-test calculatiuons for the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the revenue mean of assigned and unassinged leads for every year were done. The significance test showed that with 95% confidence, the revenue difference between the leads are:

- Account age under 1 year: from $18.2M to $40.9M
- Account age between 1 and 2 years: from $25.9M to $90.2M
- Account age between 2 ans 3 years: from $47.1M to $106.6M
- Account age between 3 and 4 years: from $35.5M to $100.5M (only 9 unassigned samples, so these values should be taken with a grain of salt)


### Conclusion: All intervals are above zero, thus we can say with 95% confidence that for accounts with ages between 1 and 4 years the incremental value for assigning a lead will be positive & in the range found in this analysis.
